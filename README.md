## Frequently Asked Questions

### What gas should I put in my Veloster?

This is probably the most-asked question. Note that this **does not apply if you are tuned**. I trust that if you're tuned, you know what gas to use.

This can be split into NAV and Turbo:

-**NAV**: 87 is fine. Putting in anything more won't really do anything for you. 

-**Turbo**: 87 is also fine. In fact, it's in the manual, and was the fuel used for the EPA fuel economy testing. If you are a "spirited driver", tuned, or track your car, 91/93 can offer you better response. For daily driving it isn't necessary. The ECU will pull timings to prevent knocking if you happen to encounter it on 87. 

Putting higher octane-rating fuel in your car does not mean it "burns cleaner" or any such nonsense. Higher octane rating = higher compression before detonation.

### What grade/brand oil should I use?

General rule of thumb in any car is to use what's on the oil fill cap.
