## Frequently Asked Questions

### What gas should I put in my Veloster?

This is probably the most-asked question. Note that this **does not apply if you are tuned**. I trust that if you're tuned, you know what gas to use.

This can be split into NAV and Turbo:

- **NAV**: 87 is fine. Putting in anything more won't really do anything for you. 

- **Turbo**: 87 is also fine. In fact, it's in the manual, and was the fuel used for the EPA fuel economy testing. If you are a "spirited driver", tuned, or track your car, 91/93 can offer you better response. For daily driving, it isn't necessary. The ECU will pull timings to prevent knocking if you happen to encounter it on 87. If you got a 1.6t and you drive like a responsible adult, you're probably not in the Facebook group to begin with, but besides that, it won't destroy your car, and you can still drive fast if you want.

Putting higher octane-rating fuel in your car does not mean it "burns cleaner", will not noticeably increase your gas mileage, or make you more attractive. Higher octane rating = higher compression before pre-ignition.

_**Do Not Put e85 In Your Car Unless You're Modded To Accomodate It**_

### What grade/brand oil should I use?

General rule of thumb in any car is to use what's on the oil fill cap. 

### What mods should I get to make more power?

Without a tune, no amount of mods are going to get you more power unfortunately. The ECU will negate the performance benefits of intakes/exhausts/etc... Things like stiffer motor mounts, sway and strut bars, and coilovers/springs can make your car _handle_ better, but won't increase HP/Torque.
